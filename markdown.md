# markdown file

markdown files are used to format texts.

these are some of the formatting options

1. headings
2. bold and italics
3. underlining
4. lists
5. tables

## headings

we usually use a # to indicate headings.

the number of #s shows the layers of heading, markdown allows from heading 1 to heading 6. heading 1 has 1 # and heading six has 6#.

# heading 1
## heading 2
### heading 3
#### heading 4
##### heading 5
###### heading 6

## bold and italics

to bolded a words, we enclose it with asterixs
this word is in bold *Hello* in this case, one set of asterix italicises the word, so two will bolden. **Hello**

another way to italicise is to use a set of underscores _Hello_

## underlining

to underline we use break elements for example,<hr> we shall see more about breaking elements in html.

## lists

there are two types of lists: ordered and non-ordered lists

### ordered lists

typically we use the numbers 1,2,3... and a period followed by a space to initialize an ordered list.

1. headings
2. bold and italics
3. underlining
4. lists
5. tables

### non-ordered lists

we use special symbols like the hyphen, asterix to make non-ordered list.

- this is a non-ordered list.

indenting a list item will add an extra layer to the list.

- this is a non-ordered list.
    - this is layer 2 of a non-ordered list .
        - this is layer 3 of a non-ordered list.
            - this is layer 4 of a non-ordered list.

## tables

for a table we use 2 hyphens separated by a verticle line. fistly we need table headers before the hyphen and the line. 

column 1 | column 2
-|-
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 3
4 | 4

great
